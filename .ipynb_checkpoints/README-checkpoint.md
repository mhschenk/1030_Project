# 1030_Project

This project explores the intersection of technology and politics, especially the question of who posts about politics online. It was prepared as a semester-long project for DATA1030, taught by Andras Zsom at Brown University in Fall 2019. 

The project makes use of two datasets. The original project proposal was based upon the Common Content of the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, which can be downloaded here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/ZSBZ7K.

The final analysis uses wave 35 of Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), available for download here: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-35/

Please see additional information about the demographic data available as part of the ATP here: https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Codebook-and-instructions-for-working-with-ATP-data.pdf
